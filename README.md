## Introduction

Depression is one of the leading causes of disability worldwide, affecting over 300 million people of all ages [Woody et al. 2017]. In Brazil, depression is a major public health issue, impacting approximately 5.8% of the population [BRASIL 2023]. Despite the significant impact of depression in Brazil, accurate and timely predictions of depression trends are still scarce, which can hinder treatment and prevention efforts. To address this gap, researchers have turned to machine learning methods, techniques, and algorithms to identify patterns from public or private databases that could be used to predict depression trends. Machine learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence that uses statistical models and algorithms to analyze datasets and identify patterns that can be used for making predictions [Alpaydin 2014]. Recent studies have demonstrated the potential of machine learning algorithms to predict depression trends in other populations [Na et al. 2020] [Sharma and Verbeke 2020].

In this study, we explore the potential of machine learning algorithms to identify profiles and key factors of depression in Brazil, using data from the most recent National Health Survey (PNS) conducted by the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE) in 2019 [Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estat√≠stica]. We propose a methodology based on domain understanding and, after data preparation steps, compare the performance of various machine learning models in characterizing depression, including Decision Trees, Random Forests, Support Vector Machines, and Artificial Neural Networks. We also identify key risk factors for depression trends in Brazil, which could inform public health policies and personalized care approaches. Our study contributes to the growing body of literature on the use of machine learning to improve mental health outcomes and highlights the potential of data-driven approaches to address the global impact of depression.
